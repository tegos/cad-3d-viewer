# cad-3d-viewer

**[Live demo](https://tegos.github.io/cad-3d-viewer/)** — drag-drop a `.step` / `.iges` / `.brep` file into the browser and look at it.
No backend, no upload, no COOP/COEP headers — the file is parsed locally by a
WebAssembly build of [Open CASCADE Technology](https://dev.opencascade.org/)
and rendered with [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/).

## Why

CAD source files (STEP, IGES, BREP) are still the canonical exchange format
for mechanical engineering work, and almost every "show me this part" workflow
still ends with someone opening a desktop CAD tool or uploading to a paid
service. The pieces to do it client-side have been available for a while —
this repo is a small, focused recipe that puts them together with Babylon.js.

Features:

- Drop any `.step` / `.stp` / `.iges` / `.igs` / `.brep` file → mesh, in 1–3 s
  for typical mechanical parts
- Per-face picking (each B-rep face is its own pickable submesh)
- Runtime exploded view (slider controls the offset, no special export needed)
- Two-point distance measurement
- Assembly-tree sidebar (toggle visibility, click a row to frame the subtree)
- One-click PNG screenshot

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # type-check + production bundle into dist/
npm run preview  # serve the built bundle
```

Open the dev server, click **"Or load a sample"** in the sidebar, or drop your
own STEP file on the canvas.

Add `?inspector=1` to the URL to open the Babylon Inspector for the scene.
Add `?debug=1` to expose `window.__scene` / `window.__engine` for the console.

## How it works

```
drop/fetch file ──▶ Web Worker (occt-import-js WASM) ──▶ JSON ──▶ Babylon.js meshes
```

1. The main thread reads the dropped file into an `ArrayBuffer` and posts it
   to a Web Worker via [Comlink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink).
2. The worker calls `ReadStepFile` / `ReadIgesFile` / `ReadBrepFile` from
   [occt-import-js](https://github.com/kovacsv/occt-import-js) — a synchronous
   C++/Emscripten call that returns a JSON describing the node hierarchy and
   triangulated meshes.
3. The main thread walks that JSON in `builder.ts` and builds a Babylon
   `TransformNode` tree, with one `Mesh` per OCCT mesh and one `SubMesh` per
   B-rep face. The per-face submeshes are what makes face picking trivial:
   `PickingInfo.subMeshId` indexes directly into a `Map<…, FaceRef>`.

The OCCT WASM binary is ~7.6 MB. It's loaded lazily — the worker spins up only
after the first load action, so the initial page paint isn't blocked.

## Gotchas worth knowing if you build something similar

- **No SharedArrayBuffer needed.** occt-import-js is a single-threaded
  Emscripten build, so you skip the COOP/COEP isolation setup entirely.
- **Use a worker.** `ReadStepFile` is synchronous C++; on a real assembly it
  blocks the calling thread for seconds. The viewport will freeze if you call
  it from the main thread.
- **Classic worker, not ESM.** The upstream UMD bundle predates the ESM-worker
  era and trips up Vite's bundler (it probes `__filename` and conditionally
  `require('fs')`). Loading it via `importScripts()` in a classic worker is
  cleaner than fighting the bundler — see `src/loader.worker.ts`.
- **`locateFile`.** Emscripten resolves `.wasm` relative to the script URL,
  which doesn't survive bundling. Always pass `locateFile` explicitly:
  ```js
  occtimportjs({ locateFile: (p) => `${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}occt-import-js/${p}` })
  ```
  The Vite `vite-plugin-static-copy` plugin publishes the WASM at that path in
  both dev and prod.
- **~100 MB ceiling.** The 32-bit Emscripten heap caps STEP parsing somewhere
  near 100 MB. This repo bails at 90 MB with a friendly toast instead of an
  obscure OOM crash.
- **STEP files carry colors.** OCCT honours the colors the STEP authoring tool
  baked in. A "dark gray plastic" part stays dark gray in the viewer — that's
  not a rendering bug, it's the source.
